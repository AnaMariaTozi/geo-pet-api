## GeoPet API

A GeoPet was created with the purpose of offering greater security for pet mothers and fathers, offering a geolocation sensor that is attached to the animal's collar, transmitting its location in real time.

In this repository, the initial part of the Back-End of this product was developed. This location service follows a REST API that provides communication with some external services such as Nominatin API and the ViaCEP API.
